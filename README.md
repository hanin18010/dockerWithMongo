Welcome to the dockerWithMongo repository! This project is a web application that leverages a combination of modern technologies to deliver a robust and scalable solution. Below is a brief overview of the tech stack and how to get started.

Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows us to build scalable network applications efficiently.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable schema for our data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which provides a schema-based solution to model our application data.
Nginx: A high-performance web server and reverse proxy server that we use to handle HTTP requests and load balancing.
Redis: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache to enhance performance and scalability.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
MongoDB (Running instance or use MongoDB Atlas)
Redis (Running instance)

Installation
Clone the Repository:

cd project-name
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory with:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT=3000
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
